I am so happy to know I helped.        \n\nThese are intrusive thoughts.     \n\nEssentially they are a result of the fact that the brain doesn't focus on/remember good or bad thoughts, but extreme thoughts. A beautiful woman walking past you and you think about her, that's a REALLY good thought, you will think about it later. Getting a 25% raise is a great thought, it will stick with you. For the same reason if you happen to think about killing your own child (you don't always get to choose what pops into your head) Your brain will recognize it as a terrible awful thing that you don't want to happen.

When you think of somebody shooting up a movie theater your brain is just \"indexing\" it into the bad category.

Don't let this happen!\"                   \n\nI have talked to a lot of people about intrusive thoughts and the big problem most people have with them is that they obsess over them. THey blame themselves for having the thought and feel like they are a terrible person for having the thought, but really all that's happening is your brain is indexing it. If somebody tells you not to think about killing your own mother, you will think about it at least for a moment simply to recognize what the person said. The thought will probably bother you and make you sad, and that's what it SHOULD do. If more people just learned to recognize that the pattern of \"have bad thought--->feel sad about it\" Is perfectly reasonable and normal, and move on, these thoughts would not bother us nearly as much.           \n\nMy dad always told me I will never have full control over what I think, but I will ALWAYS have control of what I do.

        "body": "Hi, speech and swallowing therapist here. A mix of good  and off-the-wall answers in the thread. I wanted to add a bit of anatomy to clarify.\n\nYour airway and esophagus are right next to each other. They are separated by a teeeny bit of tissue. Both start at the back of your throat, below the base of your tongue. It's almost like there is a floor that has 2 holes in it, right next to each other. \n\nWhen we talk about the airway, it's useful to break it into 2 parts: upper and lower. The dividing line betweeen upper and lower is your  voice box, aka your vocal cords. You can find those by finding your Adam's Apple (even women have a small one). Your vocal cords are just onthe other side of that bump. \n\nYour upper airway (voice box and above) is very sensitive. When stuff goes down the wrong way and it feels stuck in your throat, it's in this area. Drinking water can remove stuff in this area and flush it into the esophagus where it's supposed to go.\n\nYour lower airway (below your vocal cords, including trachea and tubes that go down to your lungs) is not very sensitive. Have you ever seen someone with a tracheostomy tube? There is a tube in their trachea and it doesn't hurt! The trachea is made of cartilage. It doesn't have a lot of blood supply or nerves. So you really don't feel stuff in your trachea.\n\n**TL; DR When you think you are feeling something in your trachea, it really isn't in your trachea. It's way higher up.**\n\nHope this clarifies a little. And I'm happy to answer any other questions about breathing and swallowing. It's literally my job.\n\nedit: changed a few words about the quality of other responses because i realized a lot of answers in this thread were really wacky! No we don't get hydrated because water passes over our cells. Our throat cells stay moist because of mucus. Lots of mucus.  \n\n**Edit 2: I'm getting a lot of PMs and questions about your personal swallowing and speech issues. Keep in mind I can't diagnose or treat you over the internet.  Also, a lot of folks wanting to know if they should get professional help for their medical issues. The rule of thumb is if an medical issue is affecting your life and makes you change how you're living, then it's time to get treatment. If your swallowing problem is making you too embarrassed to eat in public, or you have to avoid eating certain foods - GET HELP. If your speech problem is keeping you from getting or keeping a job, or makes you anxious to talk in public - GET HELP. Talk to your doctor and ask for a referral to a speech therapist. We're here to help. We're just way more effective in person.**\n\n",

You cannot breathe properly if there is a hole in your lung and such a hole could result in fluid filling the rest of your lungs. Any removal of lung has to be completely sealed, which prevents that cut region from regenerating. Similarly, because of the large blood flow to the kidneys, injury to the kidneys could easily be fatal.

Organs that are made of individual units like the lungs (small air sacks surrounded by vessels) or kidneys (filtering units surrounded by vessels and fluid ducts) cannot have a piece cut out since the organs themselves are specially sealed. You cannot breathe properly if there is a hole in your lung and such a hole could result in fluid filling the rest of your lungs. Any removal of lung has to be completely sealed, which prevents that cut region from regenerating. Similarly, because of the large blood flow to the kidneys, injury to the kidneys could easily be fatal. Cutting off a part of the kidney means it is not sealed from leaking the massive amount of blood that flows through it.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Replaced &quot;punctured&quot; with &quot;cut&quot; in second paragraph.</p>\n</div>",

A beautiful woman walking past you and you think about her, that's a REALLY good thought, you will think about it later. Getting a 25% raise is a great thought, it will stick with you.

When you think of somebody shooting up a movie theater your brain is just \"indexing\" it into the bad category.

If somebody tells you not to think about killing your own mother, you will think about it at least for a moment simply to recognize what the person said. The thought will probably bother you and make you sad, and that's what it SHOULD do. If more people just learned to recognize that the pattern of \"have bad thought--->feel sad about it\" Is perfectly reasonable and normal, and move on, these thoughts would not bother us nearly as much.           \n\nMy dad always told me I will never have full control over what I think, but I will ALWAYS have control of what I do.

        "body": "Hi, speech and swallowing therapist here. A mix of good  and off-the-wall answers in the thread. I wanted to add a bit of anatomy to clarify.\n\nYour airway and esophagus are right next to each other. They are separated by a teeeny bit of tissue. Both start at the back of your throat, below the base of your tongue. It's almost like there is a floor that has 2 holes in it, right next to each other. \n\nWhen we talk about the airway, it's useful to break it into 2 parts: upper and lower. The dividing line betweeen upper and lower is your  voice box, aka your vocal cords. You can find those by finding your Adam's Apple (even women have a small one). Your vocal cords are just onthe other side of that bump. \n\nYour upper airway (voice box and above) is very sensitive. When stuff goes down the wrong way and it feels stuck in your throat, it's in this area. Drinking water can remove stuff in this area and flush it into the esophagus where it's supposed to go.\n\nYour lower airway (below your vocal cords, including trachea and tubes that go down to your lungs) is not very sensitive. Have you ever seen someone with a tracheostomy tube? There is a tube in their trachea and it doesn't hurt! The trachea is made of cartilage. It doesn't have a lot of blood supply or nerves. So you really don't feel stuff in your trachea.\n\n**TL; DR When you think you are feeling something in your trachea, it really isn't in your trachea. It's way higher up.**\n\nHope this clarifies a little. And I'm happy to answer any other questions about breathing and swallowing. It's literally my job.\n\nedit: changed a few words about the quality of other responses because i realized a lot of answers in this thread were really wacky! No we don't get hydrated because water passes over our cells. Our throat cells stay moist because of mucus. Lots of mucus.  \n\n**Edit 2: I'm getting a lot of PMs and questions about your personal swallowing and speech issues. Keep in mind I can't diagnose or treat you over the internet.  Also, a lot of folks wanting to know if they should get professional help for their medical issues. The rule of thumb is if an medical issue is affecting your life and makes you change how you're living, then it's time to get treatment. If your swallowing problem is making you too embarrassed to eat in public, or you have to avoid eating certain foods - GET HELP. If your speech problem is keeping you from getting or keeping a job, or makes you anxious to talk in public - GET HELP. Talk to your doctor and ask for a referral to a speech therapist. We're here to help. We're just way more effective in person.**\n\n",

        "body": "Hi, speech and swallowing therapist here. A mix of good  and off-the-wall answers in the thread. I wanted to add a bit of anatomy to clarify.\n\nYour airway and esophagus are right next to each other. They are separated by a teeeny bit of tissue. Both start at the back of your throat, below the base of your tongue. It's almost like there is a floor that has 2 holes in it, right next to each other. \n\nWhen we talk about the airway, it's useful to break it into 2 parts: upper and lower. The dividing line betweeen upper and lower is your  voice box, aka your vocal cords. You can find those by finding your Adam's Apple (even women have a small one). Your vocal cords are just onthe other side of that bump. \n\nYour upper airway (voice box and above) is very sensitive. When stuff goes down the wrong way and it feels stuck in your throat, it's in this area. Drinking water can remove stuff in this area and flush it into the esophagus where it's supposed to go.\n\nYour lower airway (below your vocal cords, including trachea and tubes that go down to your lungs) is not very sensitive. Have you ever seen someone with a tracheostomy tube? There is a tube in their trachea and it doesn't hurt! The trachea is made of cartilage. It doesn't have a lot of blood supply or nerves. So you really don't feel stuff in your trachea.\n\n**TL; DR When you think you are feeling something in your trachea, it really isn't in your trachea. It's way higher up.**\n\nHope this clarifies a little. And I'm happy to answer any other questions about breathing and swallowing. It's literally my job.\n\nedit: changed a few words about the quality of other responses because i realized a lot of answers in this thread were really wacky! No we don't get hydrated because water passes over our cells. Our throat cells stay moist because of mucus. Lots of mucus.  \n\n**Edit 2: I'm getting a lot of PMs and questions about your personal swallowing and speech issues. Keep in mind I can't diagnose or treat you over the internet.  Also, a lot of folks wanting to know if they should get professional help for their medical issues. The rule of thumb is if an medical issue is affecting your life and makes you change how you're living, then it's time to get treatment. If your swallowing problem is making you too embarrassed to eat in public, or you have to avoid eating certain foods - GET HELP. If your speech problem is keeping you from getting or keeping a job, or makes you anxious to talk in public - GET HELP. Talk to your doctor and ask for a referral to a speech therapist. We're here to help. We're just way more effective in person.**\n\n",

The air contains water vapor that moves into the air from the earth around the walls and floor of your basement. Concrete absorbs water fairly easily. The water moves through it and eventually evaporates into the air on the other side.\n\nYour dehumidifier uses a cold coil of metal that attracts the water vapor in the air to condense onto it (Similar to how a cold glass of water gets wet on the outside of the glass on a warm humid day). As the condensation builds up, it drips down into the catch basin.\n\nIf you did not have a humidifier, the water vapor would remain in the air (resulting in higher humidity), and would likely condense over time onto other items in your basement. The dampness would promote the growth of mildew and mold (both things which like to grow in damp areas) and over time become a health hazard, not to mention also possibly damaging anything stored in your basement.\n\nAs an aside... Most dehumidifiers have an outlet that you can attach a hose too. I have a hose attached to mine, which then run to the basement drain. Assuming you have a basement drain, this might be a good way to avoid having to empty your dehumidifier bucket every day.",

There are essentially three types.\n\nNuclear Electric - You have a small reactor or nuclear battery and use the electricity generated from it to power some form of propulsion that relies on electricity, like ion thrusters. Unfortunately, nuclear reactors are quite heavy compared to solar panels, and ion thrusters are so slow they're not very practical for manned spaceflight. Nuclear Electric propulsion may have a future someday on a deep space probe that's too far out to rely on solar, but as far as I know nothing uses it today.\n\nNuclear Thermal - Basically, you take a nuclear reactor and pump hydrogen into it. The hydrogen heats up, you let it shoot out the back, propelling your rocket forwards. It's kind of like you just spring a leak in the reactor's cooling system. Nuclear Thermal Rockets have real promise for providing very efficient thrust, and there have been several projects in the past to experiment or develop them, including a couple that are currently ongoing. But they have problems.\n\nDue to weight concerns, shielding for the reactor would have to be kept to a minimum. Most designs provide only for a shield dividing the crew from the reactor, meaning everything around the spacecraft would be bombarded with a lot of radiation. The exhaust is also radioactive. That's less of a problem if you only use it on an upper stage and rely on a normal chemical rocket to get you to space, but that's kind of putting the cart before the horse. They're also a pain to test, since you have to collect the exhaust or give cancer to your neighbors.\n\nYou also have the shared problem with all of these designs- even proven rocket systems fail on a fairly regular basis. If you have enough material for a reactor go up in a high altitude explosion, you're going to be raining material down on a very large area. Even if it's over the ocean, you'll contaminate the food chain. It'd potentially be worse than Chernobyl.\n\nAs an aside, I'd also recommend reading about project pluto. It was a nuclear jet engine on an aircraft, not a nuclear rocket on a spacecraft, but it used a pretty similar principle- it just heated intake air rather than hydrogen fuel. It would have been a nuclear bomber that could fly practically forever, and after dropping its bombs could have spent weeks flying at low altitude to kill more people with sonic booms and radioactive exhaust.\n\nNuclear Pulse - This is the fun one. Basically, nuclear pulse engines are just shooting a nuclear bomb out the back, immediately setting it off, and riding the force of the explosion. They're utterly bonkers. They should be very efficient space propulsion, but they have added political problems. For some reason, launching a huge gun loaded with a magazine of dozens of nuclear bombs into space and having it orbit over everybody's heads doesn't make other countries happy.",

We give them TONS of training how to properly service your vehicles, plus, we ship them actual tools to fix your specific car that most repair companies can\u2019t get. </p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t worry - dealerships take in the money hand over fist and it\u2019s truly due to the parts and service departments. </p>\n</div>",

Any sharp object can rip them apart fairly easily. Of course, there are lots of larger jellies that have evolved to be more durable, or can grow big enough to withstand damage (like the Stygiomedusa gigantea, or the larger fried egg jellyfish specimens). But the vast majority are small and mostly helpless, except for their unique stinging cells, but that doesn't affect their ability to survive in a tank.\n\nIn their natural environment, they usually just float freely with the currents in the open ocean, so there's nothing for them to bump up against (except predators). They aren't strong swimmers either, so they can get stranded or trapped easily if the current washes them onto the shore or pushes them into a confined area. \n\nIn order to most closely replicate their natural environment, jellies need tanks with rounded edges to keep from getting stuck in corners, a gentle current to propel them around the tank, and a small amount of food suspended in the water. They have very specific requirements for temperature and water pH, but I don't know those details, you could probably find them on an aquarist website, though. No gravel since they could scrape against the grains and tear up their membranes. No plants since they could get stuck in the leaves. I don't think the jellyfish stings would be good for the plant either, but maybe it would be fine. \n\nAnyway, there ya go! If you want to know more just look up a jellyfish keeping guide & they'll have a lot more info.\n\nI also totally recommend looking up Stygiomedusa gigantea and fried egg jellyfish if you've never seen them before!",

I&#39;m a full time student and I spend a lot of time studying and doing flashcards to learn new material, but once I reach a certain point my mental energies are completely zapped and I can&#39;t bring myself to do anymore. I was wondering if meditation could help my brain last longer before throwing in the towel for the day.</p>\n\n<p>I also read that meditation gives you the best results when it involves you actively focusing instead of just zoning out. If this is the case, will meditation simply drain even more of my mental stamina? I am already consciously controlling my thoughts for long stretches of the day when I attempt to memorize flashcards and solve problems, how is the focus you use in meditation different?</p>\n\n<p>Just to be clear, my attention span and ability to focus on my studies are not deficient in any way.

        "selftext": "I've read that meditation can improve your mental stamina and I was wondering how exactly it does this. I'm a full time student and I spend a lot of time studying and doing flashcards to learn new material, but once I reach a certain point my mental energies are completely zapped and I can't bring myself to do anymore. I was wondering if meditation could help my brain last longer before throwing in the towel for the day.\n\nI also read that meditation gives you the best results when it involves you actively focusing instead of just zoning out. If this is the case, will meditation simply drain even more of my mental stamina? I am already consciously controlling my thoughts for long stretches of the day when I attempt to memorize flashcards and solve problems, how is the focus you use in meditation different?\n\nJust to be clear, my attention span and ability to focus on my studies are not deficient in any way. It takes me hours of flashcards to hit this wall (Also I do take breaks, get plenty of exercise and sleep, etc.). I am just looking for a way to improve my ability to focus and learn new information beyond how it is now. If possible I would love to see official articles regarding this subject, but any and all input would be greatly appreciated, thanks.",

        "body": ">This double-blind placebo-controlled study examined the effects of a typical recreational dose of MDMA (1.7 mg/kg) in 13 MDMA-naive healthy volunteers. MDMA produced an effective state of enhanced mood, well-being, and increased emotional sensitiveness, little anxiety, but no hallucinations or panic reactions. Mild depersonalization and derealization phenomena occurred together with moderate thought disorder, first signs of loss of body control, and alterations in the meaning of percepts. Subjects also displayed changes in the sense of space and time, heightened sensory awareness, and increased psychomotor drive. MDMA did not impair selective attention as measured by the Stroop test. MDMA increased blood pressure moderately, with the exception of one subject who showed a transient hypertensive reaction. This severe increase in blood pressure indicates that the hypertensive effects of MDMA, even at recreational doses, should not be underestimated, particularly in subjects with latent cardiovascular problems. Most frequent acute somatic complaints during the MDMA challenge were jaw clenching, lack of appetite, impaired gait, and restless legs. Adverse sequelae during the following 24 hours included lack of energy and appetite, feelings of restlessness, insomnia, jaw clenching, occasional difficulty concentrating, and brooding.

Heroine has received credit for a lot of deaths recently that when looked at later on people realize it comes from people combining alcohol+heroine and then falling asleep and puking and dying in that.  There's also a Reefer Madness that occurs with the government/police's favorite drug of choice at the time.  Either weed makes black men rape women in the fields and it takes 8 cops to bring them down or bath salts turn people into literal zombies.  So it can be hard to actually isolate real effects.",

The present findings are consistent with the hypothesis that MDMA produces a different psychological profile than classic hallucinogens or psychostimulants.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Vollenweider FX, Gamma A, Liechti M, Huber T. \n\u201cPsychological and cardiovascular effects and short-term sequelae of MDMA (&#39;ecstasy&#39;) in MDMA-naive healthy volunteers\u201d. \nNeuropsychopharmacology. 1998 Oct;19(4):241-51.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Effect list</p>\n\n<p>POSITIVE\nmild to extreme mood lift, euphoria\nincreased willingness to communicate\nincrease in energy (stimulation)\nego softening\ndecreased fear, anxiety, and insecurities\nfeelings of comfort, belonging, and closeness to others\nfeelings of love and empathy\nforgiveness of self and others\na sense of inner peace and acceptance of self, others, and the world\nincreased awareness &amp; appreciation of music\nincreased awareness of senses (taste, smell, touch, hearing, vision)\nincreased tactile sensation (pleasure from the sense of touch and being touched)\nlife-changing spiritual experiences\nsensations bright and intense\nurge to hug and kiss people\nanalgesia, anti-nocioception, decreased pain perception\nNEUTRAL\ndecreased appetite\nvisual distortion\nrapid, involuntary eye jiggling (nystagmus)\nmild visual hallucinations (uncommon)\nmoderately increased heart rate and blood pressure (increases with dose)\nrestlessness, nervousness, shivering\nchange in body temperature regulation\nupwellings of unexpected emotion, emotional lability\nstrong desire to do or want more when coming down\nNEGATIVE\n(negative side effects increase with higher doses and frequent use)\ninappropriate and/or unintended emotional bonding\nanxiety or paranoia (less common than opposite)\nagitation (less common than opposite)\ntendency to say things you might feel uncomfortable about later\nmild to extreme jaw clenching (trisma), tongue and cheek chewing, and teeth grinding (bruxia)\ndifficulty concentrating &amp; problems with activities requiring linear focus\nshort-term memory scramble or loss &amp; confusion\nshort periods of swooning, or disconnection from the external world, usually at very high doses or during brief blasts of intense rushing while coming up.\nimpaired ability to focus eyes / blurred vision (related to nystagmus and dilation)\nmuscle tension\ninsomnia, inability to fall asleep when physically tired\nerectile disfunction and difficulty reaching orgasm\nincrease in body temperature, hyperthermia, dehydration (drink water)\nhyponatremia (don&#39;t drink too much water)\nnausea and vomiting\nheadaches, dizziness, loss of balance, and vertigo\nsadness on coming down, sense of loss or immediate nostalgia\npost-trip Crash - unpleasantly harsh comedown from the peak effect\nhangover the next day, lasting days to weeks\nmild depression and fatigue for up to a week\nsevere depression and/or fatigue (uncommon)\npossible strong urge to repeat the experience, though not physically addictive\npossible psychological crisis requiring hospitalization (psychotic episodes, severe panic attacks, etc) (rare)\npossible liver toxicity (rare)\npossible neurotoxicity (controversial)\nsmall risk of death; approximately 2 per 100,000 new users have extreme negative reactions resulting in death (rare)</p>\n\n<p>A lot of effects in recreational drugs are often indirect, unhealthy heart taking strong stimulants, that don&#39;t occur in healthy individuals or not actually related to the drug and may come about because it was cut with something dangerous or the dose you took is &quot;incorrect&quot; because in a black market it&#39;s hard for a company to put a brand on a product and ensure the integrity.  Heroine has received credit for a lot of deaths recently that when looked at later on people realize it comes from people combining alcohol+heroine and then falling asleep and puking and dying in that.  There&#39;s also a Reefer Madness that occurs with the government/police&#39;s favorite drug of choice at the time.  Either weed makes black men rape women in the fields and it takes 8 cops to bring them down or bath salts turn people into literal zombies.  So it can be hard to actually isolate real effects.</p>\n</div>",

The amount (volume) of ejaculate will be a little more if it's been awhile since you ejaculated and less if you ejaculated recently.\n\nA man's body is constantly producing sperm and storing it up for ejaculation.  This gets mixed with fluid produced by the seminal vesicles and prostate.  Apart from frequency of ejaculation, the amount of time spent in sexual activity and the amount of arousal can also affect the volume of ejaculate.  The longer the build-up, arousal, and direct stimulation prior to ejaculation, the more volume of fluid can be produced to mix with sperm for ejaculation.  Some men also have noticed that this increase in ejaculate volume with longer stimulation also produces a waterier semen because of the increased fluid to sperm ratio.\n\nSo it stands to reason that if you are dehydrated, your volume will probably be less.  Other factors that affect it are getting proper amounts of zinc in your diet, getting good sleep, stress levels and your frequency of ejaculation.  Genetic factors and age also play a part, but those are not under your control.  Strengthening your PC muscles can produce stronger contractions on orgasm and help push out more fluid.",

        "body": "This is a conjectural question and I have a conjectural answer based on my background in Biochemistry, my current training as a PhD student in Metabolic Engineering, and my personal interest in exercise science.\n\nWe know that weight can fluctuate by a few percent on a daily basis, but that consistent weight loss on a calorie-restricted diet takes at least one week to see. In fact, many people (myself included) who aim to lose weight generally don't see much of a change for the first 2-6 weeks. This is not because they aren't losing fat, but because they are retaining some water as their fat cells begin to shrink. Fat is stored in adipocytes in big globules which shrink when fat is mobilized. Cells \"don't know\" when they will have to fill those globules up again, so they pack water in in the interim to keep the space. Many human metabolic regulatory mechanisms are thought to have evolved through feast-famine cycles, and this is one of them. \n\nAll that to say that you probably start burning up fat in less than the time it takes you to see measurable weight loss. That puts our time scale at a week or less. Now, as you mentioned, there are a lot of different energy sources we can draw on during exercise. Quick energy is generally preferred, though this depends on the duration and intensity of the exercise. If you're on a calorie-restricted diet, though, your body would prefer to use fat a little bit more than usual. So it wouldn't be impossible to begin burning up fat molecules right away during exercise! However, you don't actually burn many calories from a single cardio session. I have to run for about an hour to burn 500 calories, personally. Only a percentage of that comes from fat, and fat is calorie-dense, so it wouldn't translate to a lot of mass lost. If I ran for an hour and used 60% of the calories I burned from fat, I'd have lost just 33 g. Not a lot! This is the reason why cardio is an awful way to lose weight on its own, by the way. \n\nSo the lower limit to our time scale is minutes. But, at that time scale, we don't expect significant changes to measured weight.\n\nKnowing what I know about the dynamics of metabolic regulation (the subject of my thesis, actually), my guess is that when you restrict calories you start losing small amounts of fat immediately, but that the proportion of calories used from fat takes a few days, or even a week, to reach a maximum value. Even at that maximal rate of fat use, it might be hard to measure changes on any time scale shorter than a day because of the energy density of fat. So, if you're well into a sustainable calorie-restricted diet, controlling salt intake and exercise very carefully, you might be able to measure the weight of fat you've lost in a day. *Might* is the operative word here.\n\nThere are physiological signs of fat use, and metabolic studies use these to measure fat loss on short time scales. It's not ELI5 material, but you might consider looking at studies in which participants live in controlled environments in which everything about their metabolism - even their CO2 outputs - is carefully measured. These may be able to give you a more precise answer.  ",

In fact, many people (myself included) who aim to lose weight generally don&#39;t see much of a change for the first 2-6 weeks. This is not because they aren&#39;t losing fat, but because they are retaining some water as their fat cells begin to shrink. Fat is stored in adipocytes in big globules which shrink when fat is mobilized. Cells &quot;don&#39;t know&quot; when they will have to fill those globules up again, so they pack water in in the interim to keep the space. Many human metabolic regulatory mechanisms are thought to have evolved through feast-famine cycles, and this is one of them. </p>\n\n<p>All that to say that you probably start burning up fat in less than the time it takes you to see measurable weight loss. That puts our time scale at a week or less. Now, as you mentioned, there are a lot of different energy sources we can draw on during exercise. Quick energy is generally preferred, though this depends on the duration and intensity of the exercise. If you&#39;re on a calorie-restricted diet, though, your body would prefer to use fat a little bit more than usual. So it wouldn&#39;t be impossible to begin burning up fat molecules right away during exercise! However, you don&#39;t actually burn many calories from a single cardio session. I have to run for about an hour to burn 500 calories, personally. Only a percentage of that comes from fat, and fat is calorie-dense, so it wouldn&#39;t translate to a lot of mass lost.

It&#39;s a small amount of actual temperature difference, but those small amounts of difference can have great impact on oceans, jet streams, and many other things that have a great impact on our climate. </p>\n</div>",

If you happen to capture both some encrypted text and the corresponding unencrypted text, you can try different enigma settings until you find the right one, then apply those settings to text where you only have the encrypted version.  With Enigma, the allies relied on German weather reports, which were broadcast at the same time each day, and had parts that didn't change from day to day.\n\nThe other relies on the relative frequencies of the letters of a language's alphabet.  In German, E, N, and I are the most common letters, while Z, V, and P are the least common (not include special letters like \u00df and \u00c4 that did not appear on Enigma rotors, and Y, X and Q, were are borrowed and only used in foreign words).\n\nThat means that if there are as many N's as P's in your attempted decryption, you kept going.  As it turns out if a message has more than about 30 letters, the chances of a false decryption having letter frequencies similar to a real message become statistically insignificant.  Even if you do get a false positive, it will be obvious to a human, and you can just have the computer keep going.",

If you don't want to fight you turn your back and that's it. There are players that fight and players that don't, and it's not really a machismo/honor thing that you MUST fight. No one thinks less of you for not being a fighter.\nIf you jump someone who is NOT looking for a fight you are usually going to get tossed from the game and probably suspended for a few games to boot. It's not OK to blind-side someone who is not likewise spoiling for a fight and generally speaking that is frowned upon.\nSo the minor penalties and general lack of punishment is only in the case of two people who have collaboratively decided to go at it, which is true for almost every fight you see. They are pre-arranged (often at the face-off) and mutually agreed. At that point, two consenting adults doing what they want, basically, and the refs leave it alone until someone is at risk of getting seriously hurt -- usually once someone goes down and it's no longer a standing fight, or if other people are getting involved, or if one person is effectively incapacitated, etc.\nTo some degree hockey is a self-regulated game. Refs are there for line calls, not necessarily behavior control. 10 people flying around a small ice surface at 40km/h with wooden sticks can REALLY hurt each other while the ref is looking the other way if they want to.\nTo avoid this, fighting is used as a pressure relief... all the pent up aggression you feel for the wrongs and slights done to your team goes into cheering for your guy in the fight. Afterward everyone chills out. This is generally true even if the two guys fighting aren't the actual guys you were mad at. But the thing is, everyone on your team is going to be mad at someone different for some random thing that happened, so it's not practical to expect everyone will \"pay\" individually.\nThis mostly works because most players aren't assholes. If they do something to earn your ire it was probably by accident or a \"one time\" thing. It's unlikely you'll remember it for more than 5 minutes and unlikely that guy is going to specifically tick you off again. So the fight serves to release the cumulative pressure of all those little things, not necessarily any specific incident.\nWhere this fails is if there is just that one total dick on a team that is constantly cheap-shotting people or otherwise behaving in a douchey way not consistent with the overall tone of the game. Especially if that person keeps doing it even after a fight or two. At some point the other team is going to remember his number and a \"generic fight\" won't fix the issue. That guy now has a target painted on his back and at some point -- maybe not even that game but in a future game -- someone is going to risk getting tossed from the game/suspended to teach that specific player a lesson.\nThough usually half of that guy's own team are just as happy to watch him get creamed because, honestly, he IS a dick. We'd never say it out loud of course, team solidarity, rah rah rah... but at some point people get what they deserve and everyone on both sides knows it.\nEDIT: Others replies here have also made the very good point that I feel worth highlighting... a hockey fight is not like MMA. It's really hard to get leverage on ice and there's only so much weight you can get behind a punch. And the minute it goes to the ice the refs do get involved to stop it. The dangerous parts of hockey are at speed near the boards. A hockey fight is practically tame by comparison to what can happen there.",

        "body": "There's a big fat book called the [Almanac](http://www.efalk.org/Navigation/almanac.html) that lists all the stars and planets and sun and moon's positions along with formulae to correct for time of day and time of year. A new edition is published every year because of the motion of the planets and the moon.\n\nThen there are [other books of tables](http://www.efalk.org/Navigation/sights.html) (a 3-volume set) that let you calculate how high above the horizon any given object should be given its position in the heavens and your position on the Earth.\n\nSo: the process of navigation is as follows:\n\n* Make a good guess as to your current location. Take into account your last known location, and the direction, speed, and time you've been sailing since then. Mark that spot on the plotting sheet. That's your assumed position.\n* Pick your celestial objects. Observe them with a sextant and measure how high above the horizon they are (elevation). Note the time.\n* Go to the Almanac and find the positions of those celestial objects in the heavens for that specific time.\n* Go to the sight reduction tables and determine how high above the horizon those objects should have been, given your assumed position. Also note the direction (azimuth) of those objects.\n* For each of your sights, compare the difference between the observed elevation and the calculated elevation. Other tables in the book will tell you how to convert those differences into nautical miles.\n* Draw \"lines of position\" on your chart, offset from your assumed position by the number of nautical miles you calculated.\n* Those lines should all intersect at the same spot, more or less. That spot is where you are.\n\nHere's a [picture](http://www.efalk.org/Navigation/plot9.gif) of what your plotting sheet should look like when you're done.\n\n----\nThere are a couple of simpler methods too, of course. As /u/liarandathief points out, you can get a pretty good approximation of latitude from seeing where the north star (Polaris) is. This only works in the northern hemisphere, of course.\n\nAnother method is by sighting the noonday Sun. As local noon approaches, the navigator heads up on deck with a sextant and makes a series of sightings of the elevation of the Sun and noting the time. When the Sun hits its peak elevation (local noon), you can calculate your latitude just from the Sun's elevation and the time of year. If you have a chronometer, you can also get your longitude from the time of local noon. I.e. if your chronometer is set to Greenwich Mean time, every hour of difference between noon on your chronometer and local noon is fifteen degrees of longitude.\n\nThe passengers on ship would gamble on how much progress they'd made in the last day, so the noonday sighting was very important.\n\n----\nYou need an accurate clock to do all of this of course. When my dad was in the Coast Guard, they used a very expensive wind-up clock. It was wound every day at the same time, to the specified tension in the mainspring. Even then it wasn't all that accurate, but at least the error was known and consistent.\n\nEvery major port had an observatory whose purpose was to keep the port's master clock synchronized by observing the Sun (think of the naval observatory). Then every day at exactly noon, they'd make some sort of signal that all the ships in port could watch for or listen for so they could recalibrate their chronometers.\n\nIn some cases they'd drop a ball from a mast. This is where the tradition dropping the ball in Times Square on New Year's comes from.\n\nIn other cases, they'd fire off a signal cannon that could be heard across the entire harbor. This is the \"noonday gun\" referred to in the song \"Mad Dogs and Englishmen.\" That song is set in Hong Kong, and firing the noonday gun is still a tradition there.\n\nIn Captain Cook's day, they didn't have chronometers, and so finding the longitude was extremely difficult. The crude way is the \"lunar method\" where you observe the Moon's position against the stars and then look up in another book of tables to get an approximate time. There are corrections and corrections for the corrections at work here.\n\nFor better accuracy, Cook would put into shore from time to time, and send his astronomer onto dry land with a telescope.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>There&#39;s a big fat book called the <a href=\"http://www.efalk.org/Navigation/almanac.html\">Almanac</a> that lists all the stars and planets and sun and moon&#39;s positions along with formulae to correct for time of day and time of year. A new edition is published every year because of the motion of the planets and the moon.</p>\n\n<p>Then there are <a href=\"http://www.efalk.org/Navigation/sights.html\">other books of tables</a> (a 3-volume set) that let you calculate how high above the horizon any given object should be given its position in the heavens and your position on the Earth.</p>\n\n<p>So: the process of navigation is as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Make a good guess as to your current location. Take into account your last known location, and the direction, speed, and time you&#39;ve been sailing since then. Mark that spot on the plotting sheet. That&#39;s your assumed position.</li>\n<li>Pick your celestial objects. Observe them with a sextant and measure how high above the horizon they are (elevation). Note the time.</li>\n<li>Go to the Almanac and find the positions of those celestial objects in the heavens for that specific time.</li>\n<li>Go to the sight reduction tables and determine how high above the horizon those objects should have been, given your assumed position. Also note the direction (azimuth) of those objects.</li>\n<li>For each of your sights, compare the difference between the observed elevation and the calculated elevation. Other tables in the book will tell you how to convert those differences into nautical miles.</li>\n<li>Draw &quot;lines of position&quot; on your chart, offset from your assumed position by the number of nautical miles you calculated.</li>\n<li>Those lines should all intersect at the same spot, more or less. That spot is where you are.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s a <a href=\"http://www.efalk.org/Navigation/plot9.gif\">picture</a> of what your plotting sheet should look like when you&#39;re done.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>There are a couple of simpler methods too, of course. As <a href=\"/u/liarandathief\">/u/liarandathief</a> points out, you can get a pretty good approximation of latitude from seeing where the north star (Polaris) is. This only works in the northern hemisphere, of course.</p>\n\n<p>Another method is by sighting the noonday Sun. As local noon approaches, the navigator heads up on deck with a sextant and makes a series of sightings of the elevation of the Sun and noting the time. When the Sun hits its peak elevation (local noon), you can calculate your latitude just from the Sun&#39;s elevation and the time of year. If you have a chronometer, you can also get your longitude from the time of local noon. I.e. if your chronometer is set to Greenwich Mean time, every hour of difference between noon on your chronometer and local noon is fifteen degrees of longitude.</p>\n\n<p>The passengers on ship would gamble on how much progress they&#39;d made in the last day, so the noonday sighting was very important.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>You need an accurate clock to do all of this of course. When my dad was in the Coast Guard, they used a very expensive wind-up clock. It was wound every day at the same time, to the specified tension in the mainspring. Even then it wasn&#39;t all that accurate, but at least the error was known and consistent.</p>\n\n<p>Every major port had an observatory whose purpose was to keep the port&#39;s master clock synchronized by observing the Sun (think of the naval observatory). Then every day at exactly noon, they&#39;d make some sort of signal that all the ships in port could watch for or listen for so they could recalibrate their chronometers.</p>\n\n<p>In some cases they&#39;d drop a ball from a mast. This is where the tradition dropping the ball in Times Square on New Year&#39;s comes from.</p>\n\n<p>In other cases, they&#39;d fire off a signal cannon that could be heard across the entire harbor. This is the &quot;noonday gun&quot; referred to in the song &quot;Mad Dogs and Englishmen.&quot; That song is set in Hong Kong, and firing the noonday gun is still a tradition there.</p>\n\n<p>In Captain Cook&#39;s day, they didn&#39;t have chronometers, and so finding the longitude was extremely difficult. The crude way is the &quot;lunar method&quot; where you observe the Moon&#39;s position against the stars and then look up in another book of tables to get an approximate time. There are corrections and corrections for the corrections at work here.</p>\n\n<p>For better accuracy, Cook would put into shore from time to time, and send his astronomer onto dry land with a telescope. You can get a far more accurate time by observing the transits of Jupiter&#39;s moons. But that&#39;s not something you can do from a moving ship.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "The American system of taxation, in 25 words or less, is:\n\n* Add up everything you made **from all sources**; calculate the tax on it.\n* Add up everything you prepaid **from all sources**; resolve the difference.\n\nPretty simple, really.\n\n-----\n\nNext, although all those things you mention ARE \"taxes\", you'll have a better understanding of the system if you keep them separate:\n\n* **Federal income** tax is graduated, so some of your income is taxed at 0%, some is taxed at 10%, still more is taxed at 15%, then 25%, then 28%, and so on.\n* **State income** tax is sometimes graduated, sometimes flat-rate, for example a straight 4.25% on everything you make.  Depends on each state -- and some states don't tax **income** at all.\n* **Social Security** tax is a flat 6.20% on every dollar up to ~$118K; then it stops.\n* **Medicare** tax is a flat 1.45% on every dollar, with no limit.\n\nThese taxes are withheld from your paycheck each week or month, because the government has bills to pay each week and each month.\n\nIf you overpay, you get the excess refunded to you.  If you don't pay enough, you pay the balance due when you file your return.\n\n-----\n\nMemorize this: *\"I file a* ***return*** *to get my* ***refund*** *\".*\n\nThe tax return is the form you file.  The refund is the money you get back.  Don't misuse those terms.\n\n-----\n\n> So what exactly is the point of even paying that money in the first place if i\u2019m just gonna get it back in the end? \n\nIf you are **absolutely certain** that you won't have ANY income tax liability at the end of the year, then you fill out your W-4 form to say so, and you **won't** have any Federal Income Tax withheld.  The other taxes, though, are still due.\n\nDoes that help?\n",

Depends on each state -- and some states don&#39;t tax <strong>income</strong> at all.</li>\n<li><strong>Social Security</strong> tax is a flat 6.20% on every dollar up to ~$118K; then it stops.</li>\n<li><strong>Medicare</strong> tax is a flat 1.45% on every dollar, with no limit.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These taxes are withheld from your paycheck each week or month, because the government has bills to pay each week and each month.</p>\n\n<p>If you overpay, you get the excess refunded to you.  If you don&#39;t pay enough, you pay the balance due when you file your return.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Memorize this: <em>&quot;I file a</em> <strong><em>return</em></strong> <em>to get my</em> <strong><em>refund</em></strong> <em>&quot;.</em></p>\n\n<p>The tax return is the form you file.  The refund is the money you get back.

It translates your words -- which already follow certain rules to be understood by your compiler -- into something the underlying hardware can understand.\n\n\n**A bit less shorter:** Your source code usually gets preprocessed into a modified source code. That modified sourcecode already contains a few \"machinizations\" (just some simplifications towards the machine and compile process). A compiler creates a assembly language code (so going from a high level language to a assembly language such as x86 ASM). On that level you see operations based on registers instead of variables and objects. The assembly language code gets \"assembly'd\" into a machine code (decoded 'readable' assembly into unreadable sequences of numbers). The machine code still needs to be arranged and linked with the libraries you use. That gets done by a linker and loader (in C# you sometimes you dll's which basically correspond to that). The linker and loader takes care of putting the arrangeable machine code into the proper order for the underlying machine. The end result will be the machine code in the pure machine language consisting of the number sequences which the processor reads from a memory byte by byte (sometimes two bytes or more but thats a different topic).\n\n**A side note:** I talked about compiler languages (quite generally) here. There also exist pure interpreter languages like Python or some mixed languages like Java. Those work a bit different but the underlying principle uses similar techniques on the machine level.     \nFor interpreter languages we have a interpreter which literally interprets your source code line by line and executes system level operations straight away. This requires these operations to be written and complied once to be available on the interpreter language. So the magic is hidden there.     \nJava on the other hand -- in my opinion -- works in the inbetween way with some additional perks. We have our source code which gets compiled from a .java file into a .class file. This class-File is the java Code compiled into a assembly language like on x86 _but_ for the Java-Virtual-Machine (jvm). It contains a general set of operations which are available on pretty much any machine. The jvm on the other hand has to be created for every architecture itself. So you have a jvm for x86, one for ARM, one for amd64, ...\nThe jvm interpret the Java ASM into machine code instructions straight away for the processor to be interpreted.    \n    \n\nFor further reading I recommend books on computer architecture from Hennessy+Patterson or Tanenbaum (well when it comes to computer engineering/ comp sci that Tanenbaum guy shows up everywhere i think... he is great :) ). Also books on operating systems give insight on how the layer between the user and the processor work. Specifically about this topic i wrote about? The author of Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (Aho, et al) dive very very deep into this topic. I'd not require it but I name it because its the book which covers this topic the most. The others i mentioned are standard books on the topics i mentioned.        \n    \n\n**EDIT:** Formatting and words. -- Also my side note is longer than my actual post lol\n\n**Second side note:** Every compiler goes to similar phases I could also talk about which are very interesting.

        "body": "First let's talk about the glass on a car. Most of the windows (except the windshield) are made from tempered glass. Tempered glass is known for being quite strong, but also fails quite spectacularly, instantaneously shattering into an enormous amount of little pieces. Why does it do this? Well let's understand the processing. This glass is cooled rapidly from liquid to solid. Glass that cools more quickly ultimately ends up at a lower density, hence a higher volume compared to glass that cools slowly.\u00a0graph\u00a0Well guess what, there is a thermal gradient in a pane of glass as it cools. Meaning the outside rapidly cools and the inside does not. This puts the outside of the glass in compression and in the inside in tension. This acts as a crack inhibition method, meaning that the stress necessary to propagate the crack must first overcome the compressive stress on the outside (since glass will fail in tension well before compression). So what do we get? A glass that is ultimately very strong, but has a massive amount of stored internal energy through the tempering process.\n\nStress Profile in Tempered Glass\n\nLet's say we want to break this glass though. How do we go about it? Well if we can force a crack to propagate through this thin compressive stress layer on the outside and into the stored tensile stress region, then this crack will immediately cause catastrophic failure. The easiest way to do it? Use something small and hard to act as a stress concentrator. This can amplify the force applied and help penetrate this region.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>First let&#39;s talk about the glass on a car. Most of the windows (except the windshield) are made from tempered glass. Tempered glass is known for being quite strong, but also fails quite spectacularly, instantaneously shattering into an enormous amount of little pieces. Why does it do this? Well let&#39;s understand the processing. This glass is cooled rapidly from liquid to solid. Glass that cools more quickly ultimately ends up at a lower density, hence a higher volume compared to glass that cools slowly.\u00a0graph\u00a0Well guess what, there is a thermal gradient in a pane of glass as it cools. Meaning the outside rapidly cools and the inside does not. This puts the outside of the glass in compression and in the inside in tension. This acts as a crack inhibition method, meaning that the stress necessary to propagate the crack must first overcome the compressive stress on the outside (since glass will fail in tension well before compression). So what do we get? A glass that is ultimately very strong, but has a massive amount of stored internal energy through the tempering process.</p>\n\n<p>Stress Profile in Tempered Glass</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s say we want to break this glass though. How do we go about it? Well if we can force a crack to propagate through this thin compressive stress layer on the outside and into the stored tensile stress region, then this crack will immediately cause catastrophic failure. The easiest way to do it? Use something small and hard to act as a stress concentrator. This can amplify the force applied and help penetrate this region. So in the case of the spark plug shard, which is made from a hard ceramic (likely an alumina based material) the impact from the ceramic is enough to form a crack and cause it to penetrate the glass deep enough.

The sugar glass is far far more brittle and doesn't shard as badly.  However,  when filmed (combine with added sound effects) appears like sand glass.

However,  as a separate fun fact,  normal glass found in houses, drinking cups, etc is made from super heated sand (over 3000F).  As you know is super sturdy, hurts like hell if you break it,  etc.  You can compete this same process with sugar instead of sand.  The sugar glass is far far more brittle and doesn&#39;t shard as badly.  However,  when filmed (combine with added sound effects) appears like sand glass.  So it&#39;s far easier and safer to punch,  be near when a &quot;bullet&quot; punctures it, etc</p>\n</div>",

For example 'director' Uwe Boll, creator of the terrible video game adaptations like 'Alone in the Dark', was the center of a scheme to help rich Germans avoid paying taxes until the laws where changed.\n\nTo promote German film production the government adjusted taxes to make it less risky for German investors - if you invested money in a film and the film didn't make a profit you could treat the entire investment (100%) as a tax write off. So if you invest $1 million in a movie that flops then you get to reduce your taxes bill by up to $1 million. This meant that a movie investment (as long as it was German) would essentially carry no risk to you as long as it was equal or less than your existing tax bill. \n\nSo you're a rich German who made $15 million this year doing rich guy stuff. If you paid a 40% tax rate that would mean you'll owe the Government $6m at the end of the year and will only have $9m left. But instead you immediately give Uwe Boll $10m to make a terrible movie like 'BloodRayne'. So far all you've done is set fire to $10m and have $5m left.  But then Boll's production company wants to pay you for something, maybe they want to pay you $9m to film on your lawn for one day. So that $9m they paid you is counted as completely legal income bringing your total income this year to $24m of which you already burned $10m leaving $14m left and a new total tax bill of $9.6m (because there was nothing illegal about the $9m you where paid, it was done completely legit). At a glance this seems worse then when you started out.\n\nBut wait, that Uwe Boll movie is a complete flop (who could have seen that coming???). That $10m you ~~burned~~ invested with Uwe Boll is a 100% write off. Your $9.6m tax bill is wiped clean and you owe $0. So in effect you paid a 'tax' of only $1m (6.7%) instead of $6m (40%) and have $14m left to spend on rich German guy stuff. Also the $1m didn't go to the government, it went to Uwe Boll instead. Unfortunately he used that money to make BloodRayne.",

That will be important in a minute to explain why I know the answer. \n\nWhen you go from sitting or lying to standing, the blood in your body has to pump back to your brain after gravity takes effect and tends to pull it down into your legs. When the heart doesn't do this super efficiently (scientific, right?) you get dizzy because the blood flow to your brain is just a bit delayed. For most people, just holding still for a minute will be enough. \n\nFor people with POTS, the blood flow is extreme. Sitting/lying, my pulse will be 40-45 and then I stand and I will be 135 and sometimes that huge jump will cause fainting. Often times I can look at my legs and see they are purple from the blood pooling there. My heart is overworking to get the blood to my brain, but not super successfully. \nIn order to be diagnosed, most people get a tilt table test which is where you lie on a table and they tilt you up and down, like lying then upright over and over until you either are there 2 minutes or 3, or you pass out. It took me 30 seconds to pass out haha. Anyways, I take a beta blocker to control the pulse jump and drink salt water because salt and water increase your blood volume making it easier to move around in your body. \n\nI am just a lay person, but hopefully I not only got it all right, but it was easy to understand.
