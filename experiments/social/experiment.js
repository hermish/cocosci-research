# Consent to Participate in Research
## Overview

This HIT is a psychology experiment being conducted by Rachit Dubey, a 
  graduate student in Professor Tania Lombrozo's Concepts and Cognition Lab at 
  the University of California, Berkeley. In order to consent to participate, 
  you MUST meet the following criteria:

  - 18 years of age or older.
  - Fluent speaker of English.
  - Have not participated in this experiment before.

This study is designed to test hypotheses about the nature of people's 
  intuitive theories about the world, how they can be changed, and how they 
  influence judgments and behavior. We also hope to learn about how you 
  conceptually understand the world around you. Our intuitive sense of everyday
  objects and events in the world play a significant role in our thoughts and 
  behaviors, and we wish to understand the nature of human cognition.

  You may be asked to do one or more of the following tasks 1) causal learning
  tasks (e.g., figuring out what causes what), 2) social tasks (e.g., reasoning
  about othersâ€™ minds and behavior), 3) linguistic tasks (e.g., word
  associations and learning), 4) imagination tasks (e.g., reasoning about events
  counter to fact), 5) categorization/association tasks (e.g., grouping objects
  or stating what comes to mind given a prompt), 6) general cognitive tasks
  (e.g.,impulse control and searching for hidden objects). You may be asked to
  make judgments about what you see, answer multiple choice or open-ended
  questions about your judgments (such as making predictions and providing
  explanations), observe events, and perform actions yourself (such as grouping
  objects). Sometimes you might watch a short video clip, look at pictures, or
  listen to music, and you may be asked to answer questions about how the clip
  or music made you feel.

  You may refrain from answering any questions that make you uncomfortable and
  may withdraw your participation at any time even after completing the
  experiment without penalty. The study takes about 10 minutes to complete, for
  which you will receive $1.25.

  There are no direct benefits to you as a participant, but this research will
  help us understand various cognitive processes, which may benefit society in a
  number of ways, including influencing legal and public policy.

  We will not be asking for any personally identifying information, and we will
  handle responses as confidentially as possible. Worker IDs will never be tied
  to your responses on this survey, and IP addresses will not be collected for
  studies that ask potentially sensitive questions. However, we cannot guarantee
  the confidentiality of information transmitted over the Internet. To minimize
  this risk, data containing anything that might be personally identifiable
  (e.g. Worker IDs) will be encrypted on transfer and storage and will only be
  accessible to qualified lab personnel. We will be keeping data collected a
  part of this experiment indefinitely. This anonymized data (containing
  neither Worker IDs nor IP addresses) may be shared with the scientific
  community.
