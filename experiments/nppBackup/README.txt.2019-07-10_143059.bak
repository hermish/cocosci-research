pilot 1 - E E E E E vs H H H H E

- trend seems to be there

Pilot 2

changes:
	- removed the last question asking people if they thought they got the correct answer
	- reduced time to 10 seconds
	- Prompted 'aha' ratings every time after each anagram
	- didn't ask answers for the anagrams at all (to avoid cheating)

Pilot 3 

changes: 
    - changed delta with a four word anagram

Most likely all results we get here are because of finally getting an answer right as opposed to aha, I would prefer the below for future. 
	
pilot 2 -  flash flash flash flash hint answer vs flash flash flash flash pause answer

pilot 3 - flash(random) flash(random) flash(random) flash(random) answer vs flash(sequential) flash(sequential) flash(sequential) flash(sequential) answer

Prompt people about time to finish just like Metcalfe (1986)
